# Links to some of my work
Welcome!  These links are intended to be browsed in conjunction with my CV.
## SpinShuffle
My new mobile app, [SpinShuffle](https://spinshuffle.net), is available on the App Store and Google Play.
SpinShuffle uses both the .NET MAUI and MonoGame platforms. It is featured on the 
[MonoGame Showcase](https://monogame.net/showcase) page.

My personal website contains a [walkthrough video](https://carljohansen.wordpress.com/2024/10/24/spinshuffle-puzzle-walkthrough/). 
## Chess
As a demonstration of React/TypeScript I have built a chess-playing app. The 
[overview article](https://carljohansen.wordpress.com/2024/10/03/shallow-thought-chess-player-in-react/) includes links to the code on GitHub and a running version of the game.  For fun, I pitted it against some of the bots on [Chess.com](https://carljohansen.wordpress.com/2024/10/21/shallow-thought-versus-chess-com-bots/).

## Mandelbrot Set
Another code demo article discusses implementing a Mandelbrot Set viewer in JavaScript using 
[functional techniques](https://carljohansen.wordpress.com/2019/02/14/functional-style-programming-in-javascript-with-ramda/).

## NSubstitute code refactoring VS extension
I built a helpful Visual Studio extension for users of NSubstitute.  It is available for free on [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CarlJohansen.NSubAutoAnyArg1).  My website contains an [explanatory article](https://carljohansen.wordpress.com/2023/07/04/nsubstitute-code-refactoring-vs-extension/).

## Compiling expression trees with Roslynâ€¦ without memory leaks
I wrote [this article](https://carljohansen.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/compiling-expression-trees-with-roslyn-without-memory-leaks-2/) back in 2020 to describe a technique that I formalized for avoiding memory leaks.  Even now it still receives about three views per day from developers around the world.
